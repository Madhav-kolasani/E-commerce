## Features

* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user registration, login, and role-based access using Spring Security.
* **Product Management:** Add, view, and delete products with details like name, description, price, quantity, category, and images.
* **Category Filtering:** Browse products by category using a sidebar filter on the home page.
* **Shopping Cart:** Add products to cart, view cart items, increase/decrease quantities, and remove items.
* **Wishlist:** Add products to a personal wishlist, view wishlist items, and remove them.
* **Simulated Order Flow:**
    * Proceed from cart to a simulated payment gateway.
    * Automatic stock reduction upon order creation.
    * Simulated payment confirmation and order completion.
* **Order History:** View all past orders with details of purchased items, quantities, and total amounts.
* **Image Handling:** Upload and display product images.
* **Thymeleaf Templates:** Server-side rendered views for a traditional web application experience.
* **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies database interactions with repositories.

## Technologies Used

* **Java 8**
* **Spring Boot**: 3.x.x
* **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization.
* **Maven**: Build automation tool.
* **MySQL**: Relational database for persistence.
* **Spring Data JPA**: For database interaction and ORM.
* **Hibernate**: JPA Implementation.
* **Thymeleaf**: Templating engine for dynamic HTML views.
* **HTML5 / CSS3**: Frontend structure and styling.
* **Lombok (Optional but Recommended)**: For reducing boilerplate code (getters, setters, constructors).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8**
* **Maven 3.6+**
* **MySQL Server** (and a MySQL client like MySQL Workbench or DBeaver for database setup)
* An IDE like **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse STS** (Spring Tool Suite) is recommended.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd E-commerce
Replace <your-repository-url> with the actual URL of your Git repository.

2. Database Setup
Create a MySQL Database:
Open your MySQL client and execute the following SQL command to create a new database for your application:

SQL

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `ecommerce_db`;
Create a MySQL User (Optional but Recommended):
You might want to create a dedicated user for your application with specific privileges:

SQL

CREATE USER 'ecommerce_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `ecommerce_db`.* TO 'ecommerce_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Replace 'your_password' with a strong password.

3. Configure Application Properties
Navigate to src/main/resources/application.properties and update the database connection details.

Properties

# Database Configuration (for MySQL)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecommerce_db?useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=ecommerce_user # Or your MySQL username (e.g., root)
spring.datasource.password=your_password # Or your MySQL password

# Hibernate/JPA Configuration
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # Use 'update' to automatically create/update tables. For production, consider 'none' or 'validate'.
spring.jpa.show-sql=true # Log SQL queries
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect

# Image Upload Directory
# This will create an 'uploads/images' folder relative to your project's root directory.
# Ensure your application has write permissions to this directory.
# For production, consider a more robust external storage solution.
# No direct property needed here, it's configured in WebConfig.java
# The path is derived from System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/uploads/images/"

# Server Port (Optional)
server.port=8080
Important: Replace your_password with the actual password for your MySQL user.

4. Build the Project
Open your terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory (E-commerce) and run the Maven clean and install command:
Bash

mvn clean install
This will compile the code, run tests, and package the application into a .jar file in the target/ directory.

5. Run the Application
You can run the application using Maven Spring Boot plugin or by executing the generated JAR file:

Using Maven:

Bash

mvn spring-boot:run
Using JAR file:

Bash

java -jar target/E-commerce-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar # Adjust the version number if different
Once the application starts successfully, you can access it in your web browser at:
http://localhost:8080 (or your configured port).

Usage
User Authentication
Register: Navigate to /register to create a new user account.

Login: Access /login to log in with your credentials.

Product Management
View Products: The home page (/ or /home) displays all available products.

Add Product: Click on "Add Product" (usually available after login) to add new products. Images will be stored in uploads/images/ within your project directory.

Remove Product: Products can be removed directly from the home page (requires proper authorization, currently anyone can remove after login).

Shopping Cart
Add to Cart: Click "Add to Cart" button on product cards.

View Cart: Click "View Cart" link.

Manage Quantity: Use '+' and '-' buttons to increase/decrease item quantities in the cart.

Remove from Cart: Click "Remove" button for a specific item.

Cart Total: The cart page displays the total amount of all items.

Wishlist
Add to Wishlist: Click "Add to Wishlist" button on product cards.

View Wishlist: Click "View Wishlist" link.

Remove from Wishlist: Click "Remove" button for a specific item.

Add to Cart from Wishlist: Move items from wishlist to cart directly.

Order & Payment (Simulated)
Proceed to Buy: From the cart page, click "Proceed to Buy".

This will initiate an order, reduce product stock, clear your cart, and redirect to a simulated payment gateway.

Click "Confirm Payment (Simulated)" on the payment page to complete the order.

You will be redirected to an Order Successful page.

Order History
View Past Orders: Click "Order History" link to see a list of all your placed orders with details.

Future Improvements
User Roles & Permissions: Implement more granular roles (e.g., ADMIN, SELLER, CUSTOMER) and restrict certain actions (e.g., only ADMIN or SELLER can add/delete products).

Product Update/Edit: Add functionality to edit existing product details.

Real Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate with actual payment providers like Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal, etc.

Order Details Page: Create a page to view detailed information for a single order.

User Profile Management: Allow users to update their profile information.

Search Functionality: Implement search for products.

Pagination: For product listings, order history, etc., to handle large datasets.

Error Handling & Validation: More user-friendly error messages and robust form validation.

Frontend Enhancements: Improve UI/UX with more advanced CSS, JavaScript, or consider moving to a decoupled frontend framework (React, Angular, Vue).

Email Notifications: For order confirmations, shipping updates, etc.

Rating and Reviews: Allow users to rate and review products.

Shipping & Address Management: Add shipping addresses to user profiles and orders.

Centralized Image Storage: For production, consider cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) instead of local file system.
